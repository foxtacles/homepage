<div class="faq_answer">Christian Semmler (born 14th of January 1993), Germany<br/><br/>Code breaker, puzzle solver, hacker*, logic and language analyst.<br/><span class="smalltext">*legal software and game hacking</span><br/><br/>I'm a software engineer. I prefer statically typed, compiled programming languages.<br/>I deal with networking, code architectures, reverse engineering, template metaprogramming, and native code in general.<br/>I'm excellent at writing in my native language (German).<br/>I almost exclusively listen to 8bit, chiptunes and demoscene music.<br/>I also like <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/foxtacles/">anthropomorphic art</a> and creative people.<br/>I have what is being called Asperger's syndrome.<br/><br/>Here is a collection of quotes I value a lot.<br/><br/><i>&#8220;Art is the product of passion. Passionate developers learn new engineering processes. In turn, it will be the passionate engineer that turns into the artist.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://codesqueeze.com/why-linguists-are-true-code-artists/">--Max Pool</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;At my most cynical Java, and Design Patterned Object Orientation are paint by numbers. No one would dispute that guidelines, techniques and study are important in all craft - but just ensuring not to color outside the lines doesn't give any satisfaction. One could never write poetry in Java. It wouldn't compile.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.theorangeduck.com/page/aesthetics-code">--Daniel Holden</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;90% of programmers are incompetent&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://nuwen.net/gcc.html">--Stephan T. Lavavej</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++ doesn't offer much help&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that">--Bjarne Stroustrup</a>
