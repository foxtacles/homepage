<div class="faq_answer">Christian Semmler (born 14th of January 1993), Germany<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer. I prefer statically typed, compiled programming languages.<br/>I deal with networking, code architectures, reverse engineering, template metaprogramming, and native code in general.<br/>I mostly listen to 8bit, chiptunes, OST and demoscene music.<br/>I also like foxes, video games, and other things! Feel free to check my <a href="https://twitter.com/foxtacles">twitter</a>.<br/><br/>Here is a collection of quotes I value a lot.<br/><br/><i>&#8220;Art is the product of passion. Passionate developers learn new engineering processes. In turn, it will be the passionate engineer that turns into the artist.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://codesqueeze.com/why-linguists-are-true-code-artists/">--Max Pool</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;Programming is the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist&#8221;</i><br/>--Andy Hertzfeld<br/><br/><i>&#8220;At my most cynical Java, and Design Patterned Object Orientation are paint by numbers. No one would dispute that guidelines, techniques and study are important in all craft - but just ensuring not to color outside the lines doesn't give any satisfaction. One could never write poetry in Java. It wouldn't compile.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.theorangeduck.com/page/aesthetics-code">--Daniel Holden</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;90% of programmers are incompetent&#8221;</i><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226115036/http://nuwen.net/gcc.html">--Stephan T. Lavavej</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++ doesn't offer much help&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that">--Bjarne Stroustrup</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;What would happen if I did this impossible thing?&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://fuch.si/10h">--Scott Meyers</a><br/><br/><i>&#8220;Not writing templates in C++ is like watching porn without masturbating.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/CPPLoungeAsylum/status/354613783404085248">--Lounge C++ Asylum</a>
