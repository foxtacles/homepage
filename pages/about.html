<div class="faq_answer">Christian Semmler, 1993, Germany<br/><br/>I'm a software engineer. I prefer statically typed, compiled programming languages.<br/><a href="https://github.com/foxtacles">github</a> <a href="http://blog.zeit.io/author/foxtacles/">blog</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. A man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea or to besiege a town. A commission in the army would not be bought so dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town; and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot remain with pleasure at home.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Blaise_Pascal_works.djvu/60">--Blaise Pascal, Pens&#233;es, thought #139</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;Art is the product of passion. Passionate developers learn new engineering processes. In turn, it will be the passionate engineer that turns into the artist.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://codesqueeze.com/why-linguists-are-true-code-artists/">--Max Pool</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;The idea of programming as self-expression is now one of my strongest held beliefs and is the reason why, for personal projects, coding aesthetics are so important. The key is this: to express yourself within programming all decisions must be personal. They cannot be prescribed from a boss, textbook, or dogma. They must come from the head and heart.&#8221;</i><br/><i>&#8220;At my most cynical Java, and Design Patterned Object Orientation are paint by numbers. No one would dispute that guidelines, techniques and study are important in all craft - but just ensuring not to color outside the lines doesn't give any satisfaction. One could never write poetry in Java. It wouldn't compile.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.theorangeduck.com/page/aesthetics-code">--Daniel Holden</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++ doesn't offer much help&#8221;</i><br/><a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that">--Bjarne Stroustrup</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;My philosophy: don't read, just do. This is one of the core tenets of people who love to program.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="https://github.com/leegao/LuaInLua#philosophy">--Lee Gao</a><br/><br/>

<i>&#8220;Not writing templates in C++ is like watching porn without masturbating.&#8221;</i><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/CPPLoungeAsylum/status/354613783404085248">--Lounge C++ Asylum</a>
